Companies in financial services and other highly regulated industries often face difficulties accessing open source projects. The websites or online services that host these projects may be entirely disallowed by the firm's [Data Leak Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_loss_prevention_software) (DLP) software. Alternatively, these resources may be available in a read-only form, preventing contributions or participation in online discussions. 

## Requestion an exception

In situations like this, it's common for the IT and/or security teams to provide an exception mechanism. Check to see whether this is possible in your firm.

When applying for an exception to DLP in order to access open source projects, it's helpful to have the following information readily available:

* List of projects to which you need access and direct links to each
* The type of access needed for each (download, read-only, read-write if you need to contribute back)
    * If you'd like to contribute back to one or more projects, concrete examples of the sort of contributions you'd make can be very helpful
* Links to the security policies for each project or the service that hosts it
* Benefits of access for the firm (how will it allow you to perform your job?)

Depending upon the needs of you and your team, it may be possible to acquire a blanket exception (for instance, for all of GitHub or GitLab). Check with your IT and security teams to see whether this makes more sense than a continual series of one-off exception applications.

## Potential workarounds

* Workarounds
    * Mirror FOSS projects internally (can see the project but not contribute back)
        * Dangers of internal forks
    * git-proxy FINOS project
        * Commit internally, push out publicly
    * Use personal laptop for contributions
        * But this leaks IP
        * Could violate employment agreement
        * Still need approval to do this
    * Use personal GH account
        * Set up multiple emails
        * Use work email for work contributions
