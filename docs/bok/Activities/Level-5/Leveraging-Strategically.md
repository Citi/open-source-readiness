Refer to [Strategy](../Artifacts/Strategy) as the _output_ from this activity.

At this level, we discuss how the organization leverages Open Source as a Strategy. For this, we'll need a working model of _Strategy_ so that we can differenciate it from the processes already addressed by the previous levels. We'll leverage the model used in Wardley Mapping. As Simon Wardley points out: "all models are wrong but some are useful." This is not the only model that describes "Strategy" but it is useful in this context. The model looks at five factors and two decisioning elements that provide the building blocks for mapping, and then deciding on a course of action. The model seeks to distinguish between the actions you can take and the factors that lead you to take those actions. Those factors include _Landscape_ and _Climate_ which refer to the environment you operate in, as well as the forces in the environment that you cannot control. It also includes _Doctrine_ and _Leadership_ which refer to the capabilities you have at hand and the choices you make to leverage those cabilties. Those are in service to your _Purpose_ which describes why you are engaged in the strategic activitiy at all. Below we'll discuss Doctrine.


Shaping the organization's software strategy and processes and role of open source within the organization's software ecosystem
Bring the outside inside the organization
Help to understand and navigate project politics
Evaluate OSS projects whether technical, health or compliance assessment
Provide open source guidance to people whether managers, contributors, open source project leaders/project maintainers with their issues
Advise on which open source technologies to adopt, hold or avoid


- OSS Roadmap
- C-Level engagement
- OSS Governance charter (is this different to a policy?  Might be more public)
