Refer to [Strategy](../Artifacts/Strategy) as the _output_ from this activity.

Most companies measure their OSPO's success via the achievements made at earlier OSMM maturity levels. You've addressed a compliance concern, saved money, made engineers more productive, improved the image of your company which enabled hiring tech talent, talent who could be productive quickly since they are already familiar with your tech stack. Levels 1-4 took the organization from ad-hoc usage of open source through stages of maturity. Initially the organization focused on abating and addressing potential issues by employing basic compliance techniques. Eventually the organization established behaviors that foster engineering successes. As the organization matured, it employed generative techniques to create possibilities, such as launching a new open source project and fostering an active community. Level 5 is about [Strategy](../Artifacts/Strategy). At this level, you seek to make decisions that shape the landscape in your favor so that you can create new possibilities that were previously unavailable to you. We'll discuss strategy from different perspectives.

** Leveraging your OSPO to Improve Technology Strategy** 

How can the organization leverage Open Source as a Strategy? We'll need a working model of Strategy. Simon Wardley says: "all models are wrong, but some are useful" so let's use his. The Wardley Strategy model considers five factors that provide a framing for charting and deciding strategic actions. Factors include Landscape and Climate which refer to the environment you operate in, as well as the forces in the environment that you cannot control. They also includes Doctrine and Leadership which refer to the capabilities you have at hand and the choices you make to leverage those capabilities. Those are in service to your Purpose which describes why you are engaged in the strategic activity. Compare this to chess, where the landscape refers to the board, doctrine refers to the movements each piece can make, and so on. In order to achieve your purpose, you need to assess your current position on a landscape of options, the forces you cannot control, the behaviors you can control, and the way in which you leverage those behaviors. The journey you took that leads you to OSMM Level 5 will give you clarity on those factors. Putting this together helps you leverage Open Source more strategically. How?

Consider the work you invested in being an effective consumer of open source projects. This led you to assess the relative quality and suitability of those projects in service of your goals. It also caused you to create the mechanisms allowing you to contribute fixes and improvements to those projects. That gave you skills to operate a collaborative open source co-development activity in the community and even to publish and manage your own open source projects. The journey provided the organization with capabilities to operate across your landscape. Imagine how many more games of chess you win when you have trained your pawns to move like queens. Open Source participation also enabled you to position yourself in the marketplace, and even change parts of the marketplace landscape. With your ability to contribute features to projects you use, and get those changes adopted by the community of users at large, you reduce your technical debt. You also change the product capabilities in the marketplace to meet your needs. With your ability to create new projects that commoditize a vendor, enable partners to enter an ecosystem, and invite potential customers into a new product area. This is like a chess board where you can add rows at will, and where you can put more than one piece in a space.

Creating an effective Open Source Program Office does not make you a chess master. But it does give you and your organization capabilities that you will need to leverage. It gives you visibility into the code base that make your core products and services operate. For many, there's an overwhelming amount of code to manage. Visibility can help you track what you have and what you need to do with your code. That's at the level of source code. But for many organizations, their purpose is achieved via financial outcomes. Your OSPO must somehow help your organization save money, and in fact may help it make money. The biggest challenge with saving money is how to measure the savings. The biggest problem with making money is that the credit will go to the team you enabled. Thus, your program will likely get the most assessments at OSMM Level 4. At Level 5, you are operating at the level of trust and opportunity.

Technology Strategy Informed by Open Source Options

Shaping the organization's software strategy and processes and role of open source within the organization's software ecosystem Bring the outside inside the organization Help to understand and navigate project politics Evaluate OSS projects whether technical, health or compliance assessment Provide open source guidance to people whether managers, contributors, open source project leaders/project maintainers with their issues Advise on which open source technologies to adopt, hold or avoid
