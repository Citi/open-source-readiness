## What is a Policy?

> Policy is a deliberate system of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization.  ... Policy is a blueprint of the organizational activities which are repetitive/routine in nature. - [Policy, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy)

## Software Policy

- peter writing this

- check against mind map: policy on contribution during personal time/work time

- relationship with IP policy


## Things to Include in an Open Source Policy

- Differentiation between licenses.
- Which licenses are acceptable, and where (external and internal facing software has different restrictions)
- Communication Policy: e.g. use of social tools when communicating with foundations like FINOS, working on GitHub.  Exemptions to the broader communication policy to allow open source consumption/contribution.

## PR Policy

- Branches vs Forks: which style is allowed.  
- Archival (for communication retention purposs).
- Approach to forks:  are we contributing or maintaining an internal fork?
- Pre-ambles to PRs / Commits / Files

## Internal Open Source

 - Review Boards.  
 - Avoiding PIR leakage.
 - What are criteria for open sourcing code?
 - Under what conditions should the code be held by the bank's own organisation, vs. contributed to a foundation?

## What is an Open Source Policy?


An open source policy is a set of guidelines that outlines how an organization will consume, contribute to, and create open source software. It defines the rules that govern the use, distribution, and licensing of open source software within the organization. It establishes processes for evaluating open source software, managing the risks associated with its use, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical requirements.

## Why is an Open Source Policy Needed?

Open source software has become an integral part of modern software development. It offers a cost-effective, flexible, and collaborative way to build software solutions. However, it also brings unique challenges that need to be addressed. Without a clear policy, organizations may be at risk of legal and security issues related to open source software use. An open source policy provides a framework for managing these risks and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical requirements.

## How is an Open Source Policy Created?

Creating an open source policy involves several steps, including:

_Identify the Goals and Objectives_ - Identify the goals and objectives of the open source policy. This includes determining how the policy will support the organization's mission and strategic objectives. This starts with defining a concise policy statement, why and how the company uses or contributes to open source software, and what benefits and risks are involved. Some example goals could be:
- "We use open source software when it is the best tool, taking into account open source and proprietary alternatives, cost, quality and ease of support."
- “We see open source software as a way to reduce IT costs”
- “We see open source software as a way to foster a culture of openness and collaboration within the company and with the broad open source community. We continue to encourage employees to use, create and contribute to open source software projects that do align with the business objectives and our values”

_Determine the Scope_ - Determine the scope of the open source policy. This includes identifying the types of open source software that will be covered, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the different groups of stakeholders.

_Develop the Policy_ - Develop the policy by outlining the guidelines, rules, and best practices for consuming, contributing, and creating open source software. The policy should also define the processes for evaluating and approving open source software, managing risks, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical requirements. Risks suggested to contain mitigating the followings:
- Technical debt: Open source software may have hidden costs, such as maintenance, support, security, and compliance. Users and contributors need to be aware of the total cost of ownership and the implications of using different licenses.
- Sustainability: Open source software may depend on a small number of volunteers who may lose interest, motivation, or resources over time. Users and contributors need to ensure that the projects they rely on or contribute to have a healthy and active community, or be prepared to step in and provide alternatives if a project is losing momentum.
- Quality: Open source software may vary in quality, reliability, and performance depending on the skills and experience of the contributors. Users and contributors need to evaluate the quality of the code, documentation, testing, and reviews before using or contributing to a project. There are vendor tooling and suggested self administered maturity surveys to develop the scoring methods.
- Licensing: Open source software may have different types of licenses that impose different obligations and restrictions on the users and contributors. Users and contributors need to understand the terms and conditions of the licenses they use or contribute to, and avoid any potential legal risks or conflicts, which can be relevant in using AGPL kind of licenses.
- Security: Open source software may have vulnerabilities that expose users and contributors to cyberattacks. Users and contributors need to monitor and update their open source dependencies regularly, and follow best practices for secure development and deployment, with a special look at supply chain attack scenarios.

_Obtain Buy-in and Approval_ - Obtain buy-in and approval from stakeholders, including executives, legal, security, and IT teams.

_Communicate and Train_ - Communicate the open source policy to all stakeholders and provide training on its implementation and enforcement.

## Examples of How an Open Source Policy Covers Consuming, Contributing, and Creating Open Source Software

_Consuming Open Source Software_ - An open source policy should provide guidelines for evaluating and using open source software. For example, the policy should define the criteria for selecting open source software, such as its licensing terms, community support, and security. There are vendor tooling and suggested self administered maturity surveys to develop the scoring methods.The policy should also outline the process for assessing the risks associated with using open source software, such as identifying any vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with licensing requirements.

_Contributing to Open Source Software_ - An open source policy should also define the process for contributing to open source software. For example, the policy should outline the procedures for submitting contributions, such as code changes or bug fixes, to the open source community. The policy should also provide guidance on how to engage with the community, such as participating in forums, providing feedback, and collaborating with other contributors.

_Creating Open Source Software_ - An open source policy should provide guidelines for creating open source software. For example, the policy should define the licensing terms, the requirements for documenting the software, and the process for releasing it to the open source community. The policy should also outline the procedures for managing the software's development, such as defining the roles and responsibilities of contributors, and establishing quality control measures.
