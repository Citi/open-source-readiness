## OpenSSF - Secure Software Development Fundamentals Courses

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) has developed **free courses** for software developers on how to develop secure software.

The [“Developing Secure Software” (LFD121)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/developing-secure-software-lfd121/) course is available on the Linux Foundation Training & Certification platform. Both the course and certificate of completion are free. It is entirely online, takes about 14-18 hours to complete, and you can go at your own pace. Those who complete the course and pass the final exam will earn a certificate of completion valid for two years.

If you prefer, the same lesson content is available on edX as part of the [Secure Software Development Fundamentals Professional Certificate](http://edx.org/professional-certificate/linuxfoundationx-secure-software-development-fundamentals?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=openssf&utm_content=openssforg-securedevelopmentpc) program. You can audit the course (to learn the material) for free. If you want to try to earn a certificate of completion on edX (to prove that you learned the material), there’s a fee. On edX the content is split into 3 courses: [Secure Software Development: Requirements, Design, and Reuse (LFD104x)](https://www.edx.org/course/secure-software-development-requirements-design-and-reuse?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=openssf&utm_content=openssforg-lfd104); [Secure Software Development: Implementation (LFD105x)](https://www.edx.org/course/secure-software-development-implementation?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=openssf&utm_content=openssforg-lfd105); and [Secure Software Development: Verification and More Specialized Topics (LFD106x)](https://www.edx.org/course/secure-software-development-verification-and-more-specialized-topics?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=openssf&utm_content=openssforg-lfd106).
