The Open Source Readiness is a collaborative project aimed at developing a comprehensive body of knowledge on open source software and its ecosystem. It is a community-driven initiative that brings together individuals, organizations, and experts from different fields to contribute their knowledge and experience. The OSBOK project is based on the principle of openness and transparency, with all the content and contributions being made available under open licenses.

The OSBOK project aims to provide a reference point for individuals, organizations, and communities interested in open source software. It is designed to be a comprehensive resource for enterprises looking to consume or contribute to open source software.  It covers philosophy of open source, the different types of licenses, best practices for managing open source projects, and the tools and technologies used in open source development. The OSBOK project is expected to facilitate the adoption and growth of open source software within the enterprise and promote a better understanding of the open source ecosystem.
