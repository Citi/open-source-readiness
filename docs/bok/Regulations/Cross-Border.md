 - Many organisations are bound by what is allowed to cross their borders.  For example:  in Swiss banks, there are strong controls in place to make sure no data leaves Switzerland.  
 - This is a consideration for code too, as code _contributed to GitHub_ is data leaving the organisation and there may be requirements around these obligations.
 - Another example of why preventing contributions with "test data" in them may be good policy.
