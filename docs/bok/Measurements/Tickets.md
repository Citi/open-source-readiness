If you are running an [OSPO](../Artifacts/OSPO), does it have a support function?  If so, can you measure the amount of interaction with the OSPO and how it changes over time as a proxy for value?

**THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER**

## What To Measure

- Tickets opened in a given time period
- Mean time to close
- Satisfaction ratings
