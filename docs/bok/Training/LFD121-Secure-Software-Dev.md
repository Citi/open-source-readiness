## Synopsis


Learn the security basics to develop software that is hardened against attacks, and understand how you can reduce the damage and speed the response when a vulnerability is exploited. Thanks to the involvement of OpenSSF, a cross-industry collaboration that brings together leaders to improve the security of open source software by building a broader community, targeted initiatives, and best practices, this course provides specific tips on how to use and develop open source and other software securely.
