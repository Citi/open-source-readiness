For an organisation engaged in open source (or inner source), consider measuring the volume of contribution and charting it over time.

## What To Measure

- Number of internal staff committing to open source / inner source projects
- Number of pull-requests merged from internal staff (either on all projects or key strategic projects)
- Number of inner source / open source projects being maintained.
- How long it takes someone to have approval to contribute.
- commits / lines of code changed in a period of time.
