## Synopsis


Building and distributing software that is secure throughout its entire lifecycle can be challenging, leaving many projects unprepared to build securely by default. Attacks and vulnerabilities can emerge at any step of the chain, from writing to packaging and distributing software to end users. Sigstore is one of several innovative technologies that have emerged to improve the integrity of the software supply chain, reducing the friction developers face in implementing security within their daily work.
