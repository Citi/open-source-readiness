Open source software is typically distributed under specific [licensing terms](../../Artifacts/Licenses) and conditions that may affect how the software can be used, modified, and distributed. Compliance with these licensing requirements is essential to ensure that the organization does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of the software developers or violate the terms of the license.

- Deployment has an impact on the choice of licenses.  e.g. free-for-use machine learning packages, running on specific Nvidia chips.  Nvidia license says you shouldn't develop on the software unless you run on Nvidia hardware.  

- SGX Confidential Computing Consortium (more a hardware issue)
