title: Welcome to InnerSource
---

InnerSource can help break down silos, encourage internal collaboration and
innovation, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to
contribute software back to the open source world.

The FINOS InnerSource
[Special Interest Group](https://github.com/finos/community/tree/master/governance#special-interest-groups)
is a community of people implementing, or interested in implementing,
InnerSource within their financial services organization.

The InnerSource SIG is of particular importance to financial services
organisations who wish to accelerate their InnerSource practices, share best
practices, patterns and anti-patterns and potentially related code (e.g. for
InnerSource tooling) in a secure environment, with the aim of contributing
proven methods to FINOS and the wider InnerSource Commons community.

Where appropriate, the InnerSource SIG will also work with
[InnerSource Commons](http://www.innersourcecommons.org) to share relevant
outputs upstream to the broader InnerSource community.

Discussions have an emphasis on challenges and concerns that are particular to
FS organizations (e.g. relating to compliance or regulatory constraints).

The InnerSource SIG target audience are individuals responsible for InnerSource
implementation within financial services organizations, those in Open Source
Program Offices interested in open source culture, behaviour and skills, or tech
leaders wishing to increase collaboration and remove / deal with excessive
ownership issues that can stall innovation.
