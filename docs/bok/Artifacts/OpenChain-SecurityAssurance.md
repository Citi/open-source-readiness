[OpenChain ISO/IEC 18974:2023](https://www.openchainproject.org/security-assurance) defines the key requirements of a quality open source security assurance program.

ISO/IEC 18974:2023 helps organizations check open source for known security vulnerability issues like CVEs, GitHub dependency alerts or package manager alerts.
It identifies:

1. The key places to have security processes
2. How to assign roles and responsibilities
3. How to ensure sustainability of the processes

ISO/IEC 18974 is lightweight, easy to read and is supported by our global community with free reference material and conformance resources. Pending a successful ballot, it is expected to become a formal ISO/IEC International Standard in mid-2023.
