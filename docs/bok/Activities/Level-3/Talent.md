 - Finance organisations are great at _attracting_ talent by simply paying very high wages.  The problem is attrition.  
 - It's important to understand that lots of open source is developed for _non-financial rewards_.   
 - If you hire a key engineer who is a top contributor to an open source project then you are preventing them from contributing anymore.  They will leave.
 - Even if you allow them to continue contributing, but the workflow is onerous (e.g. MD-level reviews of their code) they will also get fed up and leave.
 - To _retain_ these high-performing staff, you have to give them the right tools to carry on contributing effectively.
 - GitHub is _becoming a CV_.
