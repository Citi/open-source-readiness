title: Considerations and Guidance for Records Management regards Open Source
sidebar_label: Record Management Policies

Financial companies do define their retention policies when comes to record management, like how email communication, internal source code, internal chat systems (all involving possible counter parties) are applied to all firm business; some of these even surveiled in real time. However, such policies only apply to what is considered firm business. As by definiton the [Open Source work is not considered a firm-related business](electronic-communications.md), only the firm wide communication policies that would be applied to the incoming email notifications from GitHub, would be applicable here.

Taking into consideration the above, the OSR group would still strongly advise people to audit and confirm with their compliance team the policies applicable.
