 - Financial firms are _technology organisations_, and all such organisations need to worry about Intellectual Property Risk.  IP Leakage can happen anywhere.  

 
 - Arguably, risks are _greater_ in finance because of the penalties that regulators may apply.
 - Historically, use of social media / sharing sites has been prohibited by many firms to mitigate data leakage.   
 - But you have to balance the data leakage risk against the benefits (outlined above).  Therefore:   can employees use a site like GitHub (where uploading data is commonplace) but have controls in place to mitigate the data-leakage aspect?
 - Tools such as [GitProxy](http://github.com/finos/Git-Proxy), personal machines, ephemeral desktops etc. help to mitigate this.  
 - _Training_ of open source developers within the organisation is an important step.  Do developers understand the rules?  Can you be explicit about what is and isn't included in a commit?  For example:  _non-code contributions_ such as test data might be outside the policy.  It's easier to have a blanket policy that this isn't allowed.  Test data needs to be generated by the tests as they run instead.
 - A _governance process_ needs to be in place for supervising contributions and observing what leaves the organisation.
 - Tools like [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise) also aim to help with Data Leakage Prevention.
 - _Evidence_ may need to be provided that data hasn't been leaked (according to regulations).
