**THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER**



1. Making the Case for an OSPO ( already written in the OSR Common Problems)

2.  Staffing the OSPO / Structures / Sizing

- link to lots of TODO docs here.

- Can the OSPO change the procurement process for software? OSS doesn't have an SLA, support agreements etc.  This requires a significant change in approach.


- Is the OSPO able to make recommendations around which open source libraries and projects to invest in?  If so, can they create metrics around how much this simplifies the technology landscape?
