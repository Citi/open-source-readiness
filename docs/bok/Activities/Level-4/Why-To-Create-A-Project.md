# "Why to create an Open Source project?"

Contributing whole projects to open source can have many reasons. When it comes to a financial institution deciding to open source, it is not different, but the reasoning behind might be different. The reasons why would do a financial company create a new open source project:

 * There is a marketing value to talk about by the corporate communications teams
 * There is a hiring value to talk about by the human resources teams
 * There is the value that the contribution would be used by others

Next to the obvious marketing and hiring values, as you target higher level activities on the OSR activities list, more crucial benefits become visible too.

However, how would you know that it would be used by others beforehand? Is it worth putting the effort into open sourcing if you do not know the answer for this question beforehand? Tha answer is about the foundational architectural aspirations of a pluggable platform.

## Foundational architectural aspiration of a pluggable platform

 * When you start, you do not know if it would be used – is this important? They might use another OSS offer or their proprietary one
 * There is no reason for a company to own every line of code – or even to find something that tries to meet all your needs
 * If your architecture pluggable, it makes it possible to selectively choose components from OSS and if needed, from commercial vendors that make sense given your requirements

## The reasons why open sourcing is a good idea

 * It enables a vendor, who is eager to get their product used, to show how their libraries, solutions are working together with your infrastructure pieces beforehand, and able to bring a more personalized demo
 * Using open source contributions can and do accelerate and highly simplifies these partnerships
 * There is a way to avoid the red tapes, the need for NDAs, the need for proprietary integrations, and to increase visibility

### An example

An actual example of how this process went an elevated the discussion:

 * A control vendor wanted to have a conversation about their control and trying to have a business relationship
 * They found an open source project from the financial company they wanted to work it that was relevant
 * They came to the discussion with the company with a customized demo using the open source project
 * Actually during the demo, the financial company was able to take their demo and use internal tooling to elevate it further as it had the compatibility due to the use of the open source library
 * Result is an instant win for both sides and making it easy to compare vendors

## Open source is the tool to work with the industry

 * Enables outsourcing and “buying” features off the shelf that give commercial momentum with faster delivery
 * Extra benefit of having a project in the open source is useful for driving the roadmap of other companies by being able to add use cases that fintech developers need

### An example

 * Strategy for development of particular area got represented through an open source project
 * Discussions based on this open source project resulted in vendors pivoting their approach
  * "XXX helped influence us on the importance of having a strategy of hybrid style applications that merge web technologies and native technologies" - CVP at vendor
 * Resulting in external joint customer showcase video with the vendor

## Open source is a tool for new ways of staff augmentation

 * Open source provides innovative methods to explore different avenues of staff augmentation
 * Eliminates onboarding needs, overhead, and results in immediate participation and contribution

### An example

 * A FINOS member company which is a sustainable enterprise and quality driven software consultancy company
 * Working with them is an opportunity to also give back and increase visibility
 * They provide services to multiple FINOS members through open source project contributions

## Open source is helping you standardize

 * If you using open source, likely this would mean that you use standard open source tooling too (for compiling, linting, code coverage, security checks and more)
 * This will help you to keep free of unnecessary bindings to internal tooling, processes and implementation
 * By using off the shelf open source build infrastructure, the capabilities could be swiftly adopted internally as well and can leverage industry leading DevOps tooling
