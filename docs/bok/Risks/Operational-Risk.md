Operational Risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human errors, systems or external events. 

> Operational risk is the risk of losses caused by flawed or failed processes, policies, systems or events that disrupt business operations. Employee errors, criminal activity such as fraud, and physical events are among the factors that can trigger operational risk.  - [Operational Risk, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_risk)

- **IT system failures**: Banks rely heavily on technology and IT systems to manage their operations and provide services to customers. If these systems fail, it can result in operational disruptions and potentially lead to financial losses.

- **Human error**: Banks have large numbers of employees who handle sensitive information and perform critical tasks. Human error, such as data entry errors or incorrect decisions, can result in operational disruptions and financial losses.

- **Fraud**: Fraud can take many forms within a bank, such as insider trading, embezzlement, or money laundering. Fraud can result in significant financial losses and damage the reputation of the bank.

## Examples

### JPMorgan Chase

**Example:** In 2014, [JPMorgan Chase suffered a data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_JPMorgan_Chase_data_breach) that compromised the personal information of approximately 76 million households and 7 million small businesses. The breach exposed names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and internal JPMorgan Chase information. The incident led to negative press coverage and public scrutiny of the bank's security practices.

> The attack—disclosed in September 2014—was discovered by the bank's security team in late July 2014, but not completely halted until the middle of August.  The bank declared that login information associated with the accounts (such as social security numbers or passwords) was not compromised but names, email and postal addresses, and phone numbers of account holders were obtained by hackers, raising concerns of potential phishing attacks. - [2014 JPMorgan Chase data breach, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_JPMorgan_Chase_data_breach)
