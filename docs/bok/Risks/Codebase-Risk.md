Large amounts of code in a project slow down development and reduce developer effectiveness because complexity has to be _managed_.  The larger a codebase, the more bugs and vulnerabilities it will contain.

Using open source software can often reduce Codebase Risk since it hands off the maintainance of portions of the codebase to third parties.   However, this doesn't mean that using open source code is risk-free.  Codebase Risk in the form of vulnerabities and functional mismatch still exist.
