Human Resources (HR) and training departments are responsible for the overall management of a company's human resources, including recruiting and hiring employees, managing employee benefits and compensation, and providing training and development opportunities.

They interact with open source software by ensuring that new employees are trained on the company's open source policies and procedures, and by providing training opportunities for employees to learn more about open source software and how to contribute to open source projects.
