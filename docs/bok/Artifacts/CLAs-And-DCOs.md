## Understanding Copyright

The article on [Licenses](Licenses) explains _copyright_ in the following way:

By default, in many jurisdictions (e.g. the US) the author of software holds the _copyright_ to it, granting them exclusive rights to the work. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) describes copyright as follows:

> A copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to copy, distribute, adapt, display, and perform a creative work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form.  - [Copyright, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright)
