It is generally preferable if an [Open Source Contribution Policy](Contribution-Compliance) can be enforced via tooling (so called _policy as code_).  However, often policy will refer to behaviours and expectations of staff which cannot be controlled through systems.  In these cases, training courses will be needed to help promote desired behaviours.  

Here, we provide an outline syllabus of a training course that covers the major areas of compliance.

## General Information About Open Source

This article focuses on the training required at [Level 3 Maturity](../../OSMM/Level-3) and makes the assumption that the training for the previous levels has been taken care of already.

**See Also**: [Consumption Training](../Level-2/Training)

Your training course may want to lay the ground work and explain some of the general details of open source, or alternatively you might fall back on the [Linux Foundation Training Courses](../../tags/LF-Training) or other internal training courses around the safe, compliant consumption of open source.

## Reasons To Allow Contribution

Your [Contribution Compliance Policy](Contribution-Compliance) will explain exactly why the firm is engaging in open source.  This should form part of the training course, making it clear to employees.  This is important since they will need to use their judgement to understand _when_ it is appropriate to make code or other materials public.

See: [Making the Case for Contribution](Making-The-Case).

## Types of Contribution

It might be helpful to explain exactly what _contribution_ means in an open source context.  _Technical_ contributions include fixing and raising issues or raising pull requests.   _Non-technical_ contributions might be documentation, answering questions, drafting training materials or speaking at events. 

## Organisational Roles

Your [Contribution Compliance Policy](Contribution-Compliance) will outline the organisational structure set up to risk-manage open source contribution.  [Developers](../../Roles/Developer) or other staff engaged in open source will need to understand and operate within this structure, so it's important to train them on it.  Roles they might need to be aware of include:

- **Foundation Points-of-Contact (POC)**:  staff within the organisation responsible for handling [Foundation Membership](Foundations).  This might be important for project creation or administration, [CLA administration](../../Artifacts/CLAs-And-DCOs) or attending events.

- **Open Source Project Administrators**: where the organisation is [Contributing its own Projects](Contributing-A-Project) or otherwise acting in a leadership role on a project, there will be someone in the firm in this role.   

- **Open Source Project Sponsors**:  in the majority of cases, the firm will have a business need to engage in an open source project.  Therefore, contributions of time or money will need to be _sponsored_ by some part of the business.  It's important that contributors are aware of who is sponsoring their contribution.

- **Contributors**: people _contributing_ code, documentation to open source projects. 

- **Reviewers**: are people who check the contributions to make sure they meet quality requirements and don't expose the firm to unnecessary risks (see below). 

- **Maintainers**: these are **contributors** on open source projects who have an elevated level of control and can gate-keep which contributions are accepted.

## Code Review 

[Code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) is a common quality assurance technique in software development and part of the [pull request](Developing-In-Public#pull-request) process.  However, within a firm the review should go further as there are more risks to consider.
