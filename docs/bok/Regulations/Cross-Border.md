<BoxOut title="Cross Border Obligations" image="/img/bok/regs/cross-border.png">

Many organisations are bound by what is allowed to cross their borders.  For example:  in Swiss banks, there are strong controls in place to make sure no data leaves Switzerland.   This is a consideration for code too, as code _contributed to GitHub_ is data leaving the organisation and there may be requirements around these obligations.
