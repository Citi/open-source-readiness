In this article we are going to look at the growing issue of software supply chain attacks via some examples and then look at the emerging field of open source supply chain security:  what it is, current best practices, the institutional landscape and emerging legislation.

This is a fast-moving area and there are lots of more authoritative sources on the internet, so this article aims to provide a light introduction to the topic with lots of references to further reading.

## Supply Chain Attacks

A software supply chain attack occurs when an attacker compromises the software development or distribution process to introduce malicious code into legitimate software or updates that are then delivered to end users.

> "A supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that seeks to damage an organization by targeting less secure elements in the supply chain.[1] A supply chain attack can occur in any industry, from the financial sector, oil industry, to a government sector.  A supply chain attack can happen in software or hardware. Cybercriminals typically tamper with the manufacturing or distribution of a product by installing malware or hardware-based spying components." - [Supply Chain Attack, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack)

### Example: Solar Winds

The SolarWinds attack, uncovered in late 2020, stands as one of the most significant and sophisticated cyber espionage campaigns ever. Attackers compromised [SolarWinds' Orion software](https://www.solarwinds.com/orion-platform), a network management tool used by numerous government agencies and large corporations worldwide. 

By doing so, the perpetrators were able to embed malicious code within legitimate software updates, enabling them to gain unauthorized access to the networks of organizations that installed these tainted updates. Once inside, they could move laterally, steal data, and potentially disrupt operations. The scale of the attack was massive, with thousands of entities affected, including key U.S. government agencies.

## Open Source Supply Chain Security

[Digital Supply Chain Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_supply_chain_security) refers to the strategies and measures implemented to protect digital assets and processes (such as software) as they move through various stages of development, distribution, and deployment - essentially trying to prevent attacks like the one above.

When focusing on open source, supply chain security becomes particularly challenging because of the communal and transparent nature of the development environment. 

Open source software often involves numerous contributors, some anonymous, and can be integrated into a wide variety of applications and platforms. As such, it's imperative to ensure that malicious actors don't introduce vulnerabilities, either inadvertently or deliberately, into these shared codebases. 

**Open source supply chain security**, therefore, emphasizes:

 - rigorous vetting of contributions
 - continuous monitoring of dependencies
 - prompt patching of known vulnerabilities
 - community collaboration to maintain the trustworthiness of shared software resources.

### Examples

- **[event-stream (2018)](https://es-incident.github.io)**: A malicious actor took over maintenance of a popular (>2m downloads per week) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package, introducing a targeted payload that stole Bitcoin funds from several users. 

- **[us-parser-js (2021)](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/10/25/npm-library-ua-parser-js-hijacked-what-you-need-to-know/)**:  Threat actors offered access to the developer account of this package on the dark web.  An installation script was introduced into the package so that the victim's computer would be used to mine crypto currency and report back user credentials.

- **[left-pad (2016)](https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)**: While SolarWinds is a high-profile, deliberate attack, the supply chain is at risk from accidental damage too. [left-pad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/left-pad) was a popular but small JavaScript library that was removed from the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) repository, unexpectedly breaking numerous dependent projects and highlighting vulnerabilities in modern software dependencies.

###Â A Growing Problem

As the volume of open source software grows, the number of open source developers increases, the cost of compute reduces and the cost of _initiating_ a supply chain attack reduces, the importance of securing the open source supply chain grows more important:

> "Supply chain attacks are increasing exponentially.  In 2021 the world witnessed a 650% increase in software supply chain attacks, aimed at exploiting weaknesses in upstream open source ecosystems. For perspective, the same statistic was 430% in the 2020 version of the report." - [State of the software Supply Chain, SonaType](https://www.sonatype.com/hubfs/Q3%202021-State%20of%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain-Report/SSSC-Report-2021_0913_PM_2.pdf)

### Transitive Dependencies

It is worth drawing attention to the issue of _transitive dependencies_.  A developer may make use of up to fifteen (say) dependencies directly in a moderately-sized software application.   However, each of these dependencies may have dependencies of their own _and so on_.

It is estimated that the average JavaScript dependency tree contains 86 packages, while for [PyPI](https://pypi.org) (Python libraries) it is 7.3. **See: **[How much do we really know about how packages behave on the npm registry?](https://snyk.io/blog/how-much-do-we-really-know-about-how-packages-behave-on-the-npm-registry/)

### Components of the Open Source Supply Chain

![Open Source Supply Chain, adapted from the LF Open Source Software Supply Chain Security article.](/img/bok/supply-chain.png)

Attacks can occur at any point in the open source supply chain, so let's look at the different parts of this system.  The above diagram (adapted from ["Open Source Software Supply Chain Security" by the Linux Foundation](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/Reports/oss_supply_chain_security.pdf?hsLang=en) shows the four main components, arranged in a cycle:

- **Users:** Individuals or systems that utilize software for various tasks and applications.
- **Package Managers:** Tools or software that automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages in a consistent manner.
- **Repositories:** Centralized storage locations or databases where software packages are archived, distributed, and made available for download.
- **Developers:** Individuals or teams responsible for creating, updating, and maintaining software codebases and packages.

Each of these is an opportunity for an attack.

## 3.   Attacks & Vulnerabilities

- [Vulnerabilities](../Artifacts/CVE) are accidentally introduced by maintainers, and may be low impact or not possible for an attacker to actually exploit. Even if you have vulnerabilities in production, you have some time to address them; they may not be discovered or exploited before you update to a fixed version.

- **Supply chain attacks** involve malware that is intentionally introduced into a package by an attacker. You don't have a few days or weeks to mitigate the issue. You need to catch it before you install it on your own laptop or on a production server.

Examples, MITRE Attack framework.


## 4.  Best Practices

### Consumption

- Checking the package... is that even possible?

- Change Control, 2FA, Versioning, Good Testing, minimizing dependencies, SCA, SAST (See below), signing, SBOMs

- mOre here: https://linuxsecurity.com/features/open-source-software-supply-chain-security

### Production

- Attestations, signatures.

Security testing is a broad term that encompasses various techniques for evaluating the security of software systems and applications. The main types of security testing include:

1. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) or Vulnerability Scanning: Vulnerability scanning involves automatically searching for known security weaknesses in software systems and applications. This type of testing can help identify potential security risks, but does not guarantee that all vulnerabilities have been found.
2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST involves analyzing the source code of an application for potential security vulnerabilities without executing the code. This type of testing can help identify potential security risks early in the development process, before the code is deployed.
3. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): DAST involves executing the code of an application and examining its behavior for potential security vulnerabilities. This type of testing can help identify potential security risks that may not be apparent from examining the code alone.
4. Penetration Testing: Penetration testing involves attempting to actively exploit vulnerabilities in a software system or application to determine its security weaknesses. This type of testing is usually conducted by security experts who use manual and automated techniques to simulate real-world attacks.
5. Web Application Security Testing: Web application security testing focuses on identifying security vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
6. Infrastructure Security Testing: Infrastructure security testing involves evaluating the security of the underlying infrastructure that supports a software system or application, such as networks, servers, and databases.
7. Mobile Application Security Testing: Mobile application security testing focuses on identifying security vulnerabilities in mobile applications, such as those running on iOS or Android platforms.

## Software Composition Analysis

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Composition_Analysis:

> **Software Composition Analysis** (SCA) is a practice in the fields of [Information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) and [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) for analyzing custom-built software applications to detect embedded open-source software and detect if they are up-to-date, contain security flaws, or have licensing requirements.

Many SCA tools produce SBOMs which can then be checked for vulnerabilities.Â Â  A long list is provided here: https://todogroup.org/guides/management-tools/#tools-for-managing-source-code

## Static Application Security Testing

See: https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/static-application-security-testing/

SAST, or Static Application Security Testing, is a type of software security testing that analyzes the source code of an application for potential security vulnerabilities without executing the code. The leading SAST tools are:

1. Checkmarx: Checkmarx is a commercial SAST tool that provides a comprehensive solution for finding security vulnerabilities in source code. It supports a wide range of programming languages and provides detailed analysis of potential security issues.
2. Veracode: Veracode is a commercial SAST tool that provides a cloud-based solution for finding security vulnerabilities in source code. It integrates with a variety of development tools and provides a range of reporting and remediation options.
3. SonarQube: SonarQube is an open source platform for continuous inspection of code quality and security. It provides a range of tools for code analysis, including SAST capabilities, and supports a wide range of programming languages.
4. Fortify: Fortify is a commercial SAST tool that provides a comprehensive solution for finding security vulnerabilities in source code. It supports a wide range of programming languages and provides detailed analysis of potential security issues.
5. Coverity: Coverity is a commercial SAST tool that provides a comprehensive solution for finding security vulnerabilities in source code. It supports a wide range of programming languages and provides detailed analysis of potential security issues.
