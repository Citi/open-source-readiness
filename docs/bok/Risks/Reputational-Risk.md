Reputational risk refers to the potential harm to an organization's reputation and credibility as a result of its actions or decisions.

> Reputational damage is the loss to financial capital, social capital and/or market share resulting from damage to a firm's reputation. This is often measured in lost revenue, increased operating, capital or regulatory costs, or destruction of shareholder value.  Ethics violations, safety issues, security issues, a lack of sustainability, poor quality, and lack of or unethical innovation can all cause reputational damage if they become known. - [Repuational Damage, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputational_damage)
