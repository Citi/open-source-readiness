It is important to make sure that your organisation's staff are able to both _efficiently and compliantly_ contribute code to open source repositories.

## What To Measure

- The time it takes to push a first PR.  i.e:
  - Developer realises there's a contribution they need to make to a repo
  - Project is internally approved for contribution
  - Developer is internally approved for contribution
  - PR is created
  - PR is approved for publication
  - PR is available on the open source repository.
