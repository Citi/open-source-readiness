<BoxOut title="Risk Officer / Compliance" image="/img/bok/roles/risk.png">

Although Risk and Compliance are separate roles within the bank, for the purposes of the body of knowledge we will be considering them a single concern.  However, it's worth understanding the difference:

- _Risk_ refers to the potential for loss, damage, or adverse outcomes arising from internal or external factors that may affect a bank's financial stability, operations, or reputation. Banks face various types of risks, including credit risk, market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, and reputational risk. Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating these risks to maintain the bank's stability and protect its assets, customers, and shareholders. 

- _Compliance_ refers to the adherence to laws, regulations, rules, and standards that govern the banking industry. Banks must comply with a wide range of regulatory requirements imposed by government agencies, central banks, and other authorities to ensure the integrity, transparency, and fairness of the financial system. Compliance involves ensuring that a bank's operations, products, services, and personnel abide by these regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) rules, Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines, data privacy laws, and capital adequacy requirements.


### Objectives

 - **Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations:** The compliance function is responsible for ensuring that the bank complies with all applicable laws and regulations, both at the local and international level. This includes monitoring changes in laws and regulations, assessing their impact on the bank, and implementing appropriate measures to ensure compliance.
 
- **Developing and implementing policies and procedures:** The compliance function is responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures that guide the bank's operations and ensure compliance with laws and regulations. These policies and procedures may cover a wide range of topics, including anti-money laundering, data protection, and customer due diligence.

- **Conducting risk assessments:** The compliance function is responsible for conducting risk assessments to identify and assess the bank's compliance risks. This includes assessing the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, as well as the risk of reputational damage or financial loss.

- **Providing training and education:** The compliance function is responsible for providing training and education to the bank's employees on compliance-related matters. This includes training on policies and procedures, as well as training on laws and regulations that are relevant to the bank's operations.

- **Monitoring and reporting:** The compliance function is responsible for monitoring the bank's compliance with laws and regulations and reporting any non-compliance to senior management and the board of directors. This includes conducting internal audits, testing controls, and reporting on the effectiveness of the bank's compliance program.
