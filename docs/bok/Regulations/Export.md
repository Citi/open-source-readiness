<BoxOut title="Export Controls" image="/img/bok/regs/export.png">

Export controls are legal and regulatory measures implemented by countries to control the export of sensitive goods, technology, software, and information for reasons related to national security, foreign policy, or economic protection. 

These controls often require exporters to secure a license before shipping certain products or technology abroad, especially if these items have potential military applications or if they're being shipped to certain countries.

**Examples:**

 - Many countries are prevented from selling into certain territories.  US/Iran for example.
 - There are rules in the US about exporting "non-standard crypto" (which might include obfuscated code).
