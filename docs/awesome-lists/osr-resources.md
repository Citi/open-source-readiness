## FINOS OSR Resources

The OSR SIG has produced several resources to help financial services firms along their open source journey. Most of these are also [open source projects](docs/projects) that you can contribute to on GitHub.

### Open Source License Compliance Handbook

A guide for complying with a wide range of open source licenses in common use cases. It's an invaluable resource for enabling developers to manage the most common compliance tasks without unnecessary legal and compliance review.

- [Check out](https://github.com/finos/OSLC-handbook) the project on GitHub

### Reference FOSS Policy

A comprehensive model corporate policy for consuming, contributing to, and publishing open source software. It's a great starting point for firms adopting their first open source policy or revising an existing one.
